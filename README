Region growing ImageJ plug-in

Just simple 2D and 3D region growing stuff. Couldn't find one that fitted my exact need
and ended up writing one more region growig plug-in. I'm working for a specific goal, so the code is straying further and further away from a generic solution.

N.B. Decided to add my own matlab dump code. Using http://bigwww.epfl.ch/sage/soft/mij/ would probably have been a good choice as well..
