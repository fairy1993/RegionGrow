Required tools to build IJGrower ImageJ plug-in:
Java SDK and ImageJ(obviously)
Git (git-scm.com/)
Ant (http://ant.apache.org/, remember to add JAVA_HOME ANT_HOME and ANT_HOME/bin to your path)


Compile ImageJ with ant, i.e. cd to imagej folder and run "ant" from command line, wait ~30 s and build should finish.


Check that the paths in ijGrower folder build.xml match the paths on your computer.
Run ant in ijGrower folder and you're done.
